## Base repos to use

These are the base repos that project-flotta needs to run as expected:

|Dependecy             | Repo                                           | Git Version                                         |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|

## Common things to all repos:

### Makefiles

By default, project use Makefiles, and all the project has a help
section where information can be obtained:

This is the example when running make help in the flotta-operator repo.

```shell
$ -> make help

## Operator installation

For running operator, you need to install the CRD first, the best way to develop
is in a small Kubernetes cluster, like Kind or Minikube.

To install Operator you need to think that there are two main parts, the CRD
installation and the operator itself.

To install CRD, you need to run the following:

```
$ -> make install
/home/eloy/dev/upstream/project-flotta/k4e-operator/bin/kustomize build config/crd | kubectl apply -f -
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/edgeconfigs.management.project-flotta.io configured
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/edgedevices.management.project-flotta.io configured
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/edgedevicesets.management.project-flotta.io configured
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/edgedevicesignedrequest.management.project-flotta.io configured
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/edgeworkloads.management.project-flotta.io configured
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/playbookexecutions.management.project-flotta.io configured
```

To run the operator, some dependencies need to be executed first, like
openshift-router and cert-manager:

```shell
make install-router
make install-cert-manager
```

To run operator locally, you can use the following code:

```shell
make run
```
To run the _Edge API_ locally, execute:

```shell
make http-api-run
```

For registering devices, it's important to download certs and set correct
permission:

~~~
$ -> sudo rm /tmp/*.pem
$ -> make get-certs
kubectl get secret -n flotta flotta-ca -o go-template='{{ index .data "ca.crt" | base64decode}}' >/tmp/ca.pem
kubectl get secret -n flotta reg-client-ca-2f5cpqwrhm -o go-template='{{ index .data "client.crt" | base64decode}}' > /tmp/cert.pem
kubectl get secret -n flotta reg-client-ca-2f5cpqwrhm -o go-template='{{ index .data "client.key" | base64decode}}' > /tmp/key.pem
$ -> sudo chown root:root /tmp/*.pem
~~~

## Device installation

On device, we have two different things to install, yggdrasil and device worker.
There are two ways to run this piece:

> ⚠️ **Golang 1.16**: By default, device needs to compile in Golang 1.16 mainly
> because this software needs to be packaged as RPM, so the version for
> RHEL8/Fedora 35 is golang 1.16

### Single way with Yggdrasil:

This way, means that Yggdrasil already knows where the device-worker is located,
and it's defined on workers.toml.

So for this, on device-worker repo the following command should be run:

```shell
sudo --preserve-env=XDG_RUNTIME_DIR,HOME,USER make install
```

This will create two files:

```shell
$ -> cat /usr/local/etc/yggdrasil/workers/device-worker.toml
exec = "/usr/local/libexec/yggdrasil/device-worker"
protocol = "grpc"
env = []
$ -> ls /usr/local/libexec/yggdrasil/device-worker
/usr/local/libexec/yggdrasil/device-worker
```

And yggdrasil can run with the following command:

```shell
sudo ./yggd \
  --log-level trace \
  --protocol http\
  --path-prefix api/flotta-management/v1\
  --client-id $(cat /etc/machine-id)\
  --cert-file /tmp/cert.pem\
  --key-file /tmp/key.pem\
  --ca-root /tmp/ca.pem\
  --server 127.0.0.1:8043
```

That you can see that device-worker is running and starting to get data from
Flotta Edge API:

```
[yggd] 2022/05/10 15:55:52 /home/eloy/dev/upstream/project-flotta/yggdrasil/cmd/yggd/main.go:201: starting yggd version 0.2.98
....
[yggd] 2022/05/10 15:55:52 /home/eloy/dev/upstream/project-flotta/yggdrasil/cmd/yggd/main.go:377: starting worker: device-worker
...
[yggd] 2022/05/10 15:55:52 /home/eloy/dev/upstream/project-flotta/yggdrasil/cmd/yggd/worker.go:114: /usr/local/libexec/yggdrasil/device-worker: Data directory: /usr/local/etc/yggdrasil/device
[yggd] 2022/05/10 15:55:52 /home/eloy/dev/upstream/project-flotta/yggdrasil/cmd/yggd/worker.go:114: /usr/local/libexec/yggdrasil/device-worker: device config file: /usr/local/etc/yggdrasil/device/device-config.json
```

Running device-worker managed by yggdrasil is how the end users run in their
devices, so this is the closest way to replicate user issues.

### Separate instance for yggdrasil and device-worker

Because separate services are useful when developing, this way is useful to be
able to separate logs from yggdrasil and device-worker, and be able to focus
only on the device-worker part:

Run yggdrasil in one tab, with the following unixsocket `@yggd`

```shell
sudo ./yggd \
  --log-level trace \
  --protocol http\
  --path-prefix api/flotta-management/v1\
  --client-id $(cat /etc/machine-id)\
  --cert-file /tmp/cert.pem\
  --key-file /tmp/key.pem\
  --ca-root /tmp/ca.pem\
  --socket-addr @yggd\
  --server 127.0.0.1:8043
```

And in other tab, just start device-worker manually, and making sure that
`/usr/local/etc/yggdrasil/workers/device-worker.toml` is not present at all.

```
sudo -E YGG_LOG_LEVEL=debug \
    YGG_CONFIG_DIR="/tmp/device" \
    YGG_SOCKET_ADDR="unix:@yggd" \
    YGG_CLIENT_ID="$(cat /etc/machine-id)" \
    FLOTTA_XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR \
    go run cmd/device-worker/main.go
```

And now, device-worker will register to the API, and start to do all
enrolment/registration phase.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issue while installing the device, check the following:
- Ensure that the location where the device is installed match the one yggdrasil is looking into. In the yggdrasil logs, you should have:
```
[yggd] 2022/05/18 09:19:17 yggdrasil/cmd/yggd/worker.go:114: /usr/local/libexec/yggdrasil/device-worker: Data directory: /usr/local/etc/yggdrasil/device
[yggd] 2022/05/18 09:19:17 yggdrasil/cmd/yggd/worker.go:114: /usr/local/libexec/yggdrasil/device-worker: device config file: /usr/local/etc/yggdrasil/device/device-config.json
```
Here the PREFIX used by yggdrasil is `/usr/local/` so you need to check that the same base path is used in the device-worker, see the `make install` output:
```
install -D -m 755 ./bin/device-worker /usr/local/libexec/yggdrasil/device-worker
```
If the base path does not match, re-install yggdrasil: ensure the environment variables PREFIX and MAKE_FLAGS are not set then, from yggdrasil folder, run `make clean install` and retry to run the device-worker.
- If there is no enrol/registration requests in the logs (both sent by device-worker or received by the operator), check if you have a file located in `${PREFIX}/etc/yggdrasil/device/device-config.json`. If so, delete it and retry to run yggdrasil. By default, PREFIX equals `/usr/local`.
- If you have 404 http status when the device tries to register, it means the edgedevice has not yet been created by the operator. 
  - Check if there is an edgedevicesignedrequest (edsr) resource matching your device id. 
  If there is none, it either means the device worker is not up-to-date, and you should update it or there was an error in the operator while processing the enrol request. In that case, check yggdrasil and operator logs
  - If the edsr exists, check if it is already approved, otherwise, edit the resource to approve it. Else, check the operator's logs to see why it is not created the associated edgedevice.
    - To approve an edsr, run the following: `kubectl edit edsr <id of the device>`. Then, search for `approved` and set the value to `true`
- If you have this error
```
[yggd] 2022/02/21 16:55:00 ./cmd/yggd/main.go:189: starting yggd version 0.2.98
cannot stop workers: cannot stop worker: cannot stop worker: cannot stop process: os: process already finished
```
Run the following command
```
sudo rm ${PREFIX}/var/run/yggdrasil/workers/device-worker.pid
```
By default PREFIX equals `/usr/local`.

- If deletion of edgedevice CR from the operator is pending, and the device is no longer present, then the de-registration process cannot be completed.
In order to forcibly remove the edgedevice CR, you need to remove the finalizers from that CR. To do so, run the following command:
```
DEVICE=<device id>
kubectl patch edgedevice/$DEVICE --type=merge -p '{"metadata": {"finalizers":null}}'
kubectl delete edgedevice/$DEVICE
```


#### device-worker cannot connect to Podman socket


Because Flotta device works uses rootless podman, can be a way that podman pod
is listening correctly but the podman user socket is not yet started. For podman
be able to run, it's important to check the status:

Error message:
